# Amazon00
Userscript for rounding the prices on amazon (eg 19.99 becomes 20.00)

To install, first you need a userscript installer, like Greasemonkey for firefox.

Then click [here](https://github.com/shelvacu/Amazon00/blob/master/amazon00.user.js) to install.

This does not work on all prices/pages sadly, however the cart and checkout pages are avoided on purpose so that the real price is not obfuscated accidentally.
